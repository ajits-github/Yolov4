The required .names file and .txt files were created.
The training and test is however carried on image size much larger than the respective one in YOLOv3 i.e. 608 x 608 and hence the training and test time is comparatively greater by almost 50 percent, for the same dataset.
This too has good visualization with Tensorboard.
